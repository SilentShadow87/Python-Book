== Introduction

=== What Is Python?
Python is an open source softwer, created by Dutch programmer Guido van Rossum. Its dynamic nature and concise code structure make it easy to learn and use.

=== What Python Can Do?
With Python programming language it is posible to accomplish wide variety of tasks. Some of domains where python can be used are:

* System Programming
* Internet Programming
* Numeric and Scientific Programming
* Game Programming
* Image Processing
* Data Processing

Thus, we can say that Python is general-purpose programming language.

=== To What Type Of Programming Python Belongs To?
Based on programming type Python is a mixture of procedural, functional and object oriented programming. It can be used equally for writing simpler scripts and for complex multifile applications.

=== What Are Advantages Compared To Other Programming Languages?
Major benefits of using Python are:

* Code readability
* Developing speed
* Program portability
* Wide range of prebuilt and third-party libraries

=== What Are Downsides?
Only significant disadventage of Python compared to fully compiled languages like C or C++ is its execution speed for some tasks. However, many tasks that require execution speed are run at C speed, because they are handled by compiled C code inside the Python interpreter. For other tasks that haven't appropriate C compiled code inside interpreter, it is posible to use compiled extensions written in some other language by linking them into the Python program. A best example for this solution is the NumPy librarie, used for numeric programming tasks.

=== Versions
There are two families of the Python versions used today, Python 2 and Python 3. Each of these version has subversions. Python 2.7 is the last release of the 2.x series. In November 2014, it was announced that Python 2.7 would be supported until 2020, but users were encouraged to move to Python 3 as soon as possible. Because of that, this book will use Python 3.7, last stable release of the 3.X series in time when this book is written.

=== Features
Pyton is interpretative, dynamic, object oriented langauge. Let's look closely to each of these features.

==== Interpretative Language
Python package, as currently implemented, contains a program known as interpreter. An interpreter is a program that executes other programs, running through program code and executing it line-by-line. As it analyses every line, an interpreter is slower than running compiled code but it can take less time to interpret program code than to compile and then run it — this is very useful when prototyping and testing code. Interpreters are written for multiple platforms, this means code written once can be run immediately on different systems without having to recompile for each.

==== Dynamic Language
Firstly, we need to explain what is type checking. Type checking is process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types. Based on moment when type checking is occured, programming languages are split in two categories:

////
https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b
////

static languages::
	Type checking takes place at compile-time. Statically-typed languages require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them. Once a variable has been declared with a type, it cannot ever be assigned to some other variable of different type and doing so will raise a type error at compile-time.
+
[source, c]
.Attempt to assign string to variable declared with an integer type will result in the type error.
----
int num;
num = 'Hello World';
----
+
Static typing usually results in compiled code that executes more quickly because when the compiler knows the exact data types that are in use, it can produce optimized machine code (i.e. faster and/or using less memory).

dynamic languages::
	Type checking takes place at run-time. Dynamically-typed languages do not require you to declare the data types of your variables before you use them. In dynamically typed languages, variables are bound to objects at run-time by means of assignment statements, and it is possible to bind the same variables to objects of different types during the execution of the program.
+
[source, python]
.Attempt to assign object of different type to the same variable is perfectly fine for dynamic languages.
----
num = 3;
num = 'spam';
----
+
The absence of a separate compilation step means that you don’t have to wait for the compiler to finish before you can test your code changes. This makes the debug cycle much shorter and less cumbersome.


Also, there is a division to on the *strongly* and *weakly* typed languages. The former does not allow implicit type conversion, while the latter allow.

----
a = “5” + 2;
----

Previous example of adding a string and an integer together will perform type conversion and give result for weakly typed languages, while for strongly typed languages type error will occur.

Now, we can conclude that Python is dynamic, strongly typed language. Python automatically allocates memory for objects, and garbage collects them when they are not longer used.

==== Object Oriented Language
In Python, everything (integers, strings, list, dictionaries, functions, modules ...) is an object, and all objects are `first class` objects. The best description of this was given by the creator himself:

[quote, Guido van Rossum]
____
One of my goals for Python was to make it so that all objects were "first class." By this, I meant that I wanted all 	objects that could be named in the language (e.g., integers, strings, functions, classes, modules, methods, etc.) to 	have equal status. That is, they can be assigned to variables, placed in lists, stored in dictionaries, passed as 		arguments, and so forth.
____

Every object in Python has its id, type and content:

id::
	A unique identifier of an object, represent as integer returned by built-in function id(object_reference_name). Object id can not be changed.

type::
	A type of the given object, returned by built-in function type(object_reference_name). It gives some usefull information about objects of that type (How much memory needs to be allocated to store object, which attributes and methods they have, etc). Object type can not be changed.

content::
	Content of some objects can be changed without changing its id or type (modify in place), for others it's not allowed.

=== How Python Runs Program?
If you wish to execute Python code, you must run that code through Python interpreter. Roughly, there are two steps that Python interpreter do in the proccess of executing Python script.

First step is to compile program source code into format called _byte code_. Byte code is lower-level, platform-independent representation of original sorce code. In this step, every statement in source code is translated into group of byte code instructions. This kind of code is faster than program source code.

Once compiled, source code can be saved into file, and can be used next time skipping compilation step. This provide startup speed optimization. For Python 3.2 and later, this byte code is stored in subdirectory named \\__pycache__ alongside source code file. Naming convention for files inside \\__pycache__ directory is that file name identifies Python version used for compiling, ending with __.pyc__ extension (e.g., spam.cpython-36.pyc). This applies only to files that have been imported, not for top-level scripts or code typed at the interactive prompt.

Next time, when program is executed, Python interpreter will search \\__pycache__ directory for file with appropriate name (name that matches module name and version of Python interpreter that runs program). If such file exists, and if it is up-to-date, Python will load that file and skip compilation step. Otherwise, if compiled version of source code not exists or if source code is modified in the meantime, compiling step is performed.

NOTE: Python can execute .pyc file even if coresponding .py file is absent. Because byte code is platform independent, it can be used for ship Python program.

Second step is to execute instructions from byte code, one by one. This task is handled by Python Virtual Machine (PVM). PVM is code loop that iterates through byte code and in each iteration pulls out and processes one instruction at a time. The PVM is the runtime engine of Python.

.Python’s traditional runtime execution model: source code you type is translated to byte code, which is then run by the Python Virtual Machine. Your code is automatically compiled, but then it is interpreted.

=== A Programmer Perspective
There are multiple ways to execute Python code. You can do that interactivly, by typing code into interactive prompt, or by saving code into files and executing code from that files in a variety of ways. Let's take a closer look at both of these possibilities.

==== The Interactive Prompt
The easiest way to start Python interactive session is to type *python* without any arguments at your bash terminal. For example:

....
$ python
Python 3.7.4 (default, Sep 28 2019, 17:44:28)
[GCC 7.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

....

To get out from the session press Ctrl-D, or type exit() or quit() at interactive prompt.

[#python_executable_rules]
When you type python at terminal, your operating system search for executable program by looking for it in list of directories specified in PATH environment variable. If executable is located in a directory that is not part of that list, there is couple of ways to run it:

* Using full path to the Python executable, */usr/local/bin/python* e.g.
* By going inside directory where is Python executable located with command *cd*, and than typing *python*
* By setting PATH environment variable to contain directory where is Python executable located. In that case, simple *python* suffices to run Python executable from any working directory.

Eather way or another, when interactive session is started Python displays prompt *>>>* as visual guides for interactive code entry. When there is a need for continuation lines *...* prompt is displayed. Inside interactive session Python interpreter executes code on each line immediately on Enter key press. In case of continuation lines (when *...* prompt is shown) Enter key need to be pressed twice. Output that entered code produce is displayed immediately below code line:

....
>>> print('Hello World!')
Hello World!
>>> for i in range(3):
...     print(i)
...
    0
    1
    2
....

Code entered at Python interactive prompt is not saved in files. Interactive session is not intended for that. Instead, it's purpose is to allow the programmers both, to experiment with the language and to test code stored in files. If programmer is not sure how some piece of Python code works, he/she can easily start interactive session and give some attempts to figure out what is hapening. Also, it is possible to test code written in files (a.k.a. modules) by importing them into interactive session. From there, programmer can test functions and classes of the imported module. This is possible for both, Python built-in modules and custom user written modules.

==== Run Code From Files
When there is a need for frequent use of some Python cohttps://www.index.hr/de,that code can be saved in files. In the Python world these files are called *modules* ( Module files that are run directly are usually called scripts ). There are number of ways to execute code from such files, but regardless of how it is run Python interpreter goes through that file from top to bottom, executing line by line.

Name of file that contains Python code is usually end with .py suffix. Mentioned suffix is optional for top-level program files ( a.k.a. scripts ), but it is mandatory for the imported files. For the sake of consistency, it is recomended to use .py suffix for all Python files. Next listing shows simple Python code, saved in file __script1.py__, that prints string 'Hello World!' to the standard output:

.script1.py
[source, python]
----
print('Hello World!')
----

Such file can be executed from the system schell prompt by listing its filename as the first argument to a python command Command python is the same Python executable program that is used for starting Python interactive prompt, so the same <<python_executable_rules, rules>> for running it applies here:

....
$ python script1.py
Hello World!
....

This example assumes that script.py file is located in the current working directory. If that is not the case, full path to the file ( absolute or relative ) must be specified.

As already stated, as response to the python shell command Python interpreter runs the code in the file line by line. As result, Hello World! message is shown on the screen.

On Unix-like systems it's possible to turn file of Python code into standalone executable. To make it happen two conditions must be satisfied:

* The very first line of the script must starts with the **#!** characters ( a.k.a **shebang** ) followed, without spaces, by the path to the Python executable. This way operating system knows which interpreter should be used to run this file.
* Script execute permission must be set ( For safety reasons, it's not set by default. Command **chomd +x <file_name>** will do the job. ). This way operating system knows that file may be run directly, as standalone executable.

Lets take a look at the program saved in script2.py file:

.script2.py
[source, python]
----
!#/usr/bin/python3
print('Hello World!')
----

If execute permission is set with the __chmod +x script2.py__ command, then, for eaxmple, this script can be run as standalone executable:

....
$ ./script2.py
Hello World!
....

Path to the Python interpreter in the shebang line can be hardcoded, like in the previous example, or **env** program can be used to lacate Python interpreter according to the system search path settings ( looking in all the directories listed in the PATH environment variable ). Because Python interpreter may be installed in different places on different machines, latter is generally recommended way today:

.script3.py
[source, python]
----
!#/usr/bin/env python3
print('Hello World!')
----
